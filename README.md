# Household-Electricity-Consumption-Forecasting
This project aims to predict household electricity consumption using historical data and machine learning models. It leverages various data sources, including smart meter readings and weather data, to build a forecasting model.

#**Installation**

Clone this repository: git clone <https://github.com/Mayur2157/Household-Electricity-Consumption-Forecasting>
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (Include the actual dependencies from your project in the requirements.txt file)

#**Usage**

Prepare your data (see data/ for examples).
Run the forecasting script: python forecast.py (Replace 'forecast.py' with the actual name of your script)
View the results. (Specify how the results will be presented, e.g., in the console, saved to a file, or displayed in a GUI)

#**Forecasting Methods**

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
Exponential Smoothing
Potentially: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
Potentially: Gradient Boosting algorithms

#**Data**

Historical electricity consumption data (kW) with timestamps
Weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.)
Holiday schedules
Special event information
